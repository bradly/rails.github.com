      <h2>Supported versions</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-8">
    	<p>
        Support of the Rails framework is divided into four groups: New features, bug fixes,
        security issues, and severe security issues. They are handled as follows:
      </p>

    	<h5>New Features</h5>
    	<p>
        New Features are only added to the master branch and will not be made available in point releases.
      </p>

    	<h5>Bug fixes</h5>
    	<p>
        Only the latest release series will receive bug fixes. When enough bugs are fixed and
        its deemed worthy to release a new gem, this is the branch it happens from.
      </p>

      <ul>
      	<li>Current release series: 4.2.x</li>
      </ul>

    	<h5>Security issues:</h5>
    	<p>
        The current release series and the next most recent one will receive patches
        and new versions in case of a security issue.
      </p>

      <ul>
      	<li>Current release series: 4.2.x</li>
        <li>Next most recent release series: 4.1.x</li>
      </ul>

    	<h5>Severe security issues:</h5>
    	<p>
        For severe security issues we will provide new versions as above, and
        also the last major release series will receive patches and new versions.
        The classification of the security issue is judged by the core team.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Current release series: 4.2.x</li>
        <li>Next most recent release series: 4.1.x</li>
        <li>Last major release series: 3.2.x</li>
      </ul>

    	<h5>Unsupported Release Series</h5>
      <p>
        When a release series is no longer supported, it’s your own responsibility
        to deal with bugs and security issues. We may provide back-ports of the
        fixes and publish them to git, however there will be no new versions
        released. If you are not comfortable maintaining your own versions, you
        should upgrade to a supported version.

    	<h2>Reporting a bug</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-8">
    	<p>
        All security bugs in rails should be reported through our
        <a href="https://hackerone.com/rails">bounty program page at HackerOne</a>. This will
        deliver a message to a subset of the <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/core">core team</a>
        who handle security issues. Your report will be acknowledged within 24 hours, and you’ll
        receive a more detailed response to your email within 48 hours indicating the next
        steps in handling your report.
      </p>

	    <p>
        After the initial reply to your report the security team will
        endeavor to keep you informed of the progress being made towards a fix and full
        announcement. These updates will be sent at <strong>least</strong> every five days,
        in reality this is more likely to be every 24-48 hours.
      </p>

    	<p>
        If you have not received a reply to your email within 48 hours, or have not heard
        from the security team for the past five days there are a few steps you can take:
      </p>

    	<ol>
      	<li>Send an email to the security reports list (<a href="mailto:security@rubyonrails.org">security@rubyonrails.org</a>)</li>
      	<li>Contact the current security coordinator (<a href="mailto:michael@koziarski.com">Michael Koziarski</a>) directly </li>
    		<li>Contact the back-up contact (<a href="mailto:jeremy@bitsweat.net">Jeremy Kemper</a>) directly.</li>
    		<li>Email the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-core">rails core list</a> or ask in #rails-contrib</li>
    	</ol>

    	<p>
        Please note, the rails core list and #rails-contrib are public areas. When escalating
        to that address please do not discuss your issue, simply say that you’re trying to get
        a hold of someone from the security team.

    	<h2>Disclosure Policy</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-8">
    	<p>Ruby on Rails has a 5 step disclosure policy.</p>

    	<ol>
      	<li>
          Security report received and is assigned a primary handler.
          This person will coordinate the fix and release process.
        </li>
    		<li>
          Problem is confirmed and, a list of all affected versions is determined.
          Code is audited to find any potential similar problems.
        </li>
		    <li>
          Fixes are prepared for all releases which are still supported.
          These fixes are <strong>not</strong> committed to the public
          repository but rather held locally pending the announcement.
        </li>
    		<li>
          A suggested embargo date for this vulnerability is chosen and
          <a href="http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros">distros@openwall</a>
          is notified. This notification will include  patches for all versions
          still under support and a contact address for packagers who need
          advice back-porting patches to older versions.
        </li>
    		<li>
          On the embargo date, the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security">rails security mailing list</a>
          is sent a copy of the announcement. The changes are pushed to the public repository
          and new gems released to rubygems. At least 6 hours after the mailing list is notified,
          a copy of the advisory will be published on <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org">Riding Rails</a>
        </li>
    	</ol>

    	<p>
        Typically the embargo date will be set 72 hours from the time
        <a href="http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros">distros@openwall</a>
        is first notified, however this may vary depending on the severity of the bug
        or difficulty in applying a fix.
      </p>

    	<p>
        This process can take some time, especially when coordination is required with
        maintainers of other projects. Every effort will be made to handle the bug in
        as timely a manner as possible, however it’s important that we follow the release
        process above to ensure that the disclosure is handled in a consistent manner.

    	<h2>Receiving Security Updates</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-8">
    	<p>
        The best way to receive all the security announcements is to subscribe to the
        <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security">rails security
        mailing list</a>. The mailing list is <strong>very</strong> low traffic, and
        it receives the public notifications the moment the embargo is lifted. If you
        produce packages of Ruby on Rails and require prior notification of vulnerabilities,
        you should be subscribed to
        <a href="http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros">distros@openwall</a>.
      </p>

    	<p>
        No one outside the core team, the initial reporter or
        <a href="http://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros">distros@openwall</a>
        will be notified
        prior to the lifting of the embargo. We regret that we cannot make exceptions to
        this policy for high traffic or important sites, as any disclosure beyond the
        minimum required to coordinate a fix could cause an early leak of the vulnerability.
